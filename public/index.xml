      <description>Welp we ran into a problem. First night in and I lose a filling. I bit straight into a block of cheese and the cheese took my filling.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;re back in a suburb of Seattle right now I&amp;rsquo;ve since gotten a replacement. Thankfully my mom had not left Seattle yet so she was able to pick us up and take me to the dentist.&#xA;The first day/night out was interesting.The trail is unfortunately worse than we&amp;rsquo;d have hoped.</description>

      <description>Well, I finally got this blog setup. It only took me till the day before we start walking.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;re currently in Winthrop, WA staying at a nice Airbnb. Winthrop is a small town in the Northern Cascades. The city and locals have all been really nice. Kind of a cool little city, one of the main streets looks like it is from the old west.&#xA;The view around our Airbnb.</description>

      <description>This is a simple blog covering the journey of me, Mark (left), and my brother, Scott (right), as we hike the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about doing for a long time, and with both of us graduating college recently, we figured now is the perfect time to embark on this adventure.&#xA;I plan to update this site every one to two weeks with accounts of our day-to-day experiences and some photos of the best views we encounter.</description>
