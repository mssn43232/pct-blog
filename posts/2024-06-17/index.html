First night in and I lose a filling. I bit straight into a block of cheese and the cheese took my filling.</p><p>We&rsquo;re back in a suburb of Seattle right now I&rsquo;ve since gotten a replacement. Thankfully my mom had not left Seattle yet so she was able to pick us up and take me to the dentist.</p><p>The first day/night out was interesting.The trail is unfortunately worse than we&rsquo;d have hoped. Large chunks of the trail are covered in snowpack making travel slow and exhausting. On exposed sections it makes the trail much more dangerous.</p><p>We camped out in a place called Windy Pass so I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine how that went. Snow covered most of the area but we managed to find a small dry spot that was unfortunately somewhat open to the wind. It beat sleeping on the snow though.</p><p>With all of this in mind I think we are going to skip going to the Canadian border then backtracking and we are just going to head south from here.</p><p>We were talking to some other hikers and they let us know it was getting worse towards the Canadian border. What should normally be a 3 to 5 day hike would now be a 6 to 10 day hike for people like Scott and I. The snow makes everything harder.</p><p>So that&rsquo;s are plan, slip touching the Canadian border and just head down south from Hearts Pass to Stehekin.</p><p>Here are some pictures.</p><p><img src=/pct-blog/images/campsite.jpg alt="Snowed in campsite"><br>Our Campsite.
