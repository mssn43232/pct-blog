It only took me till the day before we start walking.
We&amp;rsquo;re currently in Winthrop, WA staying at a nice Airbnb. Winthrop is a small town in the Northern Cascades. The city and locals have all been really nice. Kind of a cool little city, one of the main streets looks like is from the old west.
We&amp;rsquo;re currently doing some final preparations before we head out tomorrow.</description></item></channel></rss>
