Well, I finally got this blog setup. It only took me till the day before we start walking. 

We're currently in Winthrop, WA staying at a nice Airbnb. Winthrop is a small town in the Northern Cascades.
The city and locals have all been really nice. Kind of a cool little city, one of the main streets looks like is from the old west. 

We're currently doing some final preparations before we head out tomorrow. We've got all of our gear ready to go for the most part just need to shed some more weight to get the pack as light as possible.
