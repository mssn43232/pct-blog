Welp we ran into a problem. First night in and I lose a filling. I bit straight into a block of cheese and the cheese took my filling. 

We're back in a suburb of Seattle right now I've since gotten a replacement. Thankfully my mom had not left Seattle yet so she was able to pick us up and take me to the dentist. 

The first day/night out was interesting.The trail is unfortunately worse than we'd have hoped. Large chunks of the trail are covered in snowpack making travel slow and exhausting. On exposed sections it makes the trail much more dangerous. 

We camped out in a place called Windy Pass so I'm sure you can imagine how that went. Snow covered most of the area but we managed to find a small dry spot that was unfortunately somewhat open to the wind. It beat sleeping on the snow though.

With all of this in mind I think we are going to skip going to the Canadian border then backtracking and we are just going to head south from here.

We were talking to some other hikers and they let us know it was getting worse towards the Canadian border. What should normally be a 3 to 5 day hike would now be a 6 to 10 day hike for people like Scott and I. The snow makes everything harder. 

So that's are plan, slip touching the Canadian border and just head down south from Hearts Pass to Stehekin.

Here are some pictures.
