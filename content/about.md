![Scott and I](/images/about.jpg)

This is a simple blog covering the journey of me, Mark, and my brother, Scott, as we hike the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). It's something I've thought about doing for a long time, and with both of us graduating college recently, we figured now is the perfect time to embark on this adventure.

I plan to update this site every one to two weeks with accounts of our day-to-day experiences and some photos of the best views we encounter. Feel free to follow along with us!

For site navigation, the home page has every post I've added to the site. The photos page has every photo I've added in a single place where you can swipe through all of them.
